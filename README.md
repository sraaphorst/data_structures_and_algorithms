# Coursera Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization course from UC San Diego:

Specialization webpage: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms

This is a six-part course offered by Coursera to specialize in advanced data structures and algorithms.

I am working predominantly in C++ and Python3 for this course, but may delve into some Java and Haskell as well.

Note that the Python scripts require, to be graded properly, a comment:

`#Uses Python3`

instead of the usual shebang.
